# Quick Start - iOS Export with HealthKit & Geolocation

## Prerequisites
- Node.js installed
- Xcode installed (macOS only)
- iOS device for testing (HealthKit doesn't work in simulator)

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Core Capacitor
npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli @capacitor/ios

# Plugins
npm install @capacitor-community/health
npm install @capacitor/geolocation
```

## Step 2: Initialize Capacitor

```bash
# Initialize project
npx cap init "Papi Steps" "com.papisteps.app"

# Add iOS platform
npx cap add ios
```

## Step 3: Configure iOS Project

### Edit `ios/App/App/Info.plist` and add:

```xml
<key>NSHealthShareUsageDescription</key>
<string>Papi Steps needs access to your step count to help Papi grow with your daily walking activity.</string>

<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>Papi Steps needs your location to find nearby friends and connect with other walkers.</string>
```

## Step 4: Build and Sync

```bash
# Build web assets
npm run build

# Sync to iOS
npx cap sync ios

# Open in Xcode
npx cap open ios
```

## Step 5: Enable HealthKit in Xcode

1. In Xcode, select your app target
2. Go to "Signing & Capabilities"
3. Click "+ Capability"
4. Add "HealthKit"

## Step 6: Run on Device

1. Connect your iPhone via USB
2. Select your device in Xcode
3. Click Run (âŒ˜R)
4. App will launch and request permissions

## Features Ready to Test

### âœ… Apple Health Integration
- Daily step count syncs automatically
- Updates every 5 minutes
- Shows in progress bar on home screen

### âœ… Nearby Friends
- Uses device location
- Finds friends within 5km
- Shows distance and user info
- Refresh button to update

## Console Logs to Watch

Open Safari Developer Tools (for iOS device) or Xcode console:

```
HealthKit available: true
Requesting HealthKit permission...
Steps data loaded: 8547
User location: { latitude: 37.7749, longitude: -122.4194 }
Finding nearby friends within 5km...
Found 5 nearby friends: [...]
```

## Testing Without Real Health Data

The app includes mock data for development:
- Mock steps: Varies by time of day (morning: low, evening: high)
- Mock location: San Francisco coordinates
- Mock nearby friends: 3-6 random users generated

## Common Issues

### HealthKit Permission Not Appearing
- âœ… Check Info.plist has NSHealthShareUsageDescription
- âœ… HealthKit capability enabled in Xcode
- âœ… Testing on real device (not simulator)

### Location Not Working
- âœ… Check Info.plist has NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription
- âœ… Location services enabled on device
- âœ… App has location permission in Settings

### Build Fails
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
cd ios/App
pod install
cd ../..
npx cap sync ios
```

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Test permission flows
2. âœ… Verify steps sync from Health app
3. âœ… Check nearby friends feature
4. âœ… Test with real walking data
5. âœ… Review console logs for errors

## Development Tips

- Use mock data first to test UI
- Add real Health data gradually
- Test permission denied scenarios
- Check Settings app for permission status

## File Structure

```
/utils/
  â”œâ”€â”€ healthKit.ts       # Apple Health integration
  â””â”€â”€ geolocation.ts     # Location & nearby friends

/components/screens/
  â”œâ”€â”€ KawaiiHomeScreen.tsx         # Shows daily steps
  â”œâ”€â”€ KawaiiNearestPeopleScreen.tsx # Shows nearby users
  â””â”€â”€ KawaiiPermissionsScreen.tsx   # Manages permissions

App.tsx                  # Initializes services on login
```
