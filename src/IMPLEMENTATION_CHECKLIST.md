- [ ] Bundle ID configured
- [ ] No signing errors
- [ ] Certificate valid

## üß™ Phase 5: Testing (TODO)

### Development Testing (Web)

Before iOS build, test in browser:

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] App loads in browser
- [ ] Mock steps data shows
- [ ] Mock nearby friends show
- [ ] Console logs appear correctly
- [ ] No JavaScript errors

### iOS Device Testing

- [ ] App launches successfully
- [ ] Permission dialogs appear
- [ ] Can grant permissions
- [ ] Steps sync from Health app
- [ ] Location updates correctly
- [ ] Nearby friends display
- [ ] Console logs visible in Xcode

### Feature Testing
